module Paypal 
  # This is a collection of helpers which aid in the creation of paypal buttons 
  # 
  # Example:
  #
  #    <%= form_tag Paypal::Notification.ipn_url %>
  #    
  #      <%= paypal_setup "Item 500", Money.us_dollar(50000), "bob@bigbusiness.com" %>  
  #      Please press here to pay $500US using paypal. <%= submit_tag %>
  #    
  #    <% end_form_tag %> 
  #
  # For this to work you have to include these methods as helpers in your rails application.
  # One way is to add "include Paypal::Helpers" in your application_helper.rb
  # See Paypal::Notification for information on how to catch payment events. 
  module Helpers
    
    # Convenience helper. Can replace <%= form_tag Paypal::Notification.ipn_url %>
    # takes optional url parameter, default is Paypal::Notification.ipn_url
    def paypal_form_tag(url = Paypal::Notification.ipn_url, options = {})
      form_tag(url, options)
    end

    def paypal_form_tag(url = Paypal::Notification.ipn_url, options = {}, &block)
      if block
        concat(form_tag(url, options)+capture(&block)+"</form>", block.binding)
      else
        form_tag(url, options)
      end
    end

    # This helper creates the hidden form data which is needed for a paypal purchase. 
    # 
    # * <tt>item_number</tt> -- The first parameter is the item number. This is for your personal organization and can 
    #   be arbitrary. Paypal will sent the item number back with the IPN so its a great place to 
    #   store a user ID or a order ID or something like  this. 
    #
    # * <tt>amount</tt> -- should be a string of type "50.00" for 50$. Make sure you set the current currency as part 
    #   of the options hash. The default is USD
    #
    # * <tt>business</tt> -- This is your paypal account name ( a email ). This needs to be a valid paypal business account.
    #
    # The last parameter is a options hash. You can set or override any Paypal-recognized parameter, including:
    #
    # * <tt>:cmd</tt> -- default is '_xclick'.
    # * <tt>:quantity</tt> -- default is '1'.
    # * <tt>:no_note</tt> -- default is '1'.
    # * <tt>:item_name</tt> -- default is 'Store purchase'. This is the name of the purchase which will be displayed
    #   on the paypal page. 
    # * <tt>:no_shipping</tt> -- default is '1'. By default we tell paypal that no shipping is required. Usually
    #   the shipping address should be collected in our application, not by paypal. 
    # * <tt>:currency</tt> -- default is 'USD'. If you provide a Money object, that will automatically override
    #   the value.
    # * <tt>:charset</tt> -- default is 'utf-8'.
    # * <tt>:notify_url</tt> -- If provided paypal will send its IPN notification once a 
    #   purchase is made, canceled or any other status changes occur.
    # * <tt>:return</tt> -- If provided paypal will redirect a user back to this url after a 
    #   successful purchase. Useful for a kind of thankyou page. 
    # * <tt>:cancel_return</tt> -- If provided paypal will redirect a user back to this url when
    #   the user cancels the purchase.
    # * <tt>:tax</tt> -- the tax for the store purchase. Same format as the amount parameter but optional
    # * <tt>:invoice</tt> -- Unique invoice number. User will never see this. optional
    # * <tt>:custom</tt> -- Custom field. User will never see this. optional
    #
    # Examples:
    #   
    #   <%= paypal_setup @order.id, Money.us_dollar(50000), "bob@bigbusiness.com" %>  
    #   <%= paypal_setup @order.id, '50.00', "bob@bigbusiness.com", :currency => 'USD' %>  
    #   <%= paypal_setup @order.id, '50.00', "bob@bigbusiness.com", :currency => 'USD', :notify_url => url_for(:only_path => false, :action => 'paypal_ipn') %>  
    #   <%= paypal_setup @order.id, Money.ca_dollar(50000), "bob@bigbusiness.com", :item_name => 'Snowdevil shop purchase', :return_url => paypal_return_url, :cancel_url => paypal_cancel_url, :notify_url => paypal_ipn_url  %>
