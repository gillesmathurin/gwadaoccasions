	#   Given there are vehicles of each type in the database
	# 	And I am logged in
	# 	And I have "0" selected vehicles
	# 	And I am on "a vehicle page"
	#   When I follow "Sélectionnez"
	#   Then I should see "Véhicule ajouté à votre selection" within ".flashnotice"
	# 	And I should have "1" selected vehicles
